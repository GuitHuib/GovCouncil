        <p>
            The Massachusetts Bay Colony received its first royal charter in 1629, with the founding of Boston, 
            following the arrival in 1630 of Governor John Winthrop and a fleet of principally Puritan settlers. 
            The colony's governance was based on this charter, which included the establishment of a "council of 
            assistants." The assistants were a body of magistrates who not only decided judicial cases, but also 
            played a role in the colony's lawmaking. The assistants were elected by the colony's freemen.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the colony's original charter was revoked in 1684, there was the short-lived Dominion of New England 
            (1686-1689), which was succeeded in the territories of modern Massachusetts and Maine by the Province of 
            Massachusetts Bay. The charter for the province called for "eight and twenty assistants, or counsellors, 
            to be advising and assisting to the governor" who were to be chosen annually by the Great and General Court.
            It further specified that the council was to assume the duties of the governor in the absence of both the 
            royal governor and lieutenant governor (who were appointed by the crown), and enumerated some of the specific 
            issues on which the council was to advise the governor. During the provincial period, the relationship between 
            the governor and council was sometimes difficult, since the council represented colonial interests which diverged 
            from the crown interests of the governor. The Council also had authority over approving and accepting officer's 
            commissions in the militia.

            Unlike with the previous charter for the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, the 1691 
            Massachusetts Charter stripped the power of judicial ruling from the Council. The council would continue to "advise 
            and consent" however they would no longer hear appeals. The appeals were to be administered by the local courts and 
            any suit which was of significant sum, namely 300 Pounds sterling, would be moved to the King's Privy Council. Other 
            appointments were taken from the Council as well and given to the authority of the General Court.

            During the American Revolution, the state government operated under the Massachusetts Charter of 1691 but did so 
            without a governor. The council acted as the executive.

        <p>
            The Council generally meets at noon on Wednesdays in its State House Chamber, next to the Governor's Office. Pursuant to the 
            Massachusetts Constitution, the Governor may, in general and at his discretion, from time to time assemble the Council for the 
            ordering and directing the affairs of the commonwealth. In addition, the Governor must seek the advice and consent of the 
            Council with respect to nominations of judicial officers, appointment and removal of notaries public and justices of the 
            peace, issuance of pardons and commutations, and payment of monies from the treasury.

            Annual compensation in 2016 was $36,025.

        <h2 class="underline mt-3">Innapropriate Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            The outside conduct of some councillors has drawn public scrutiny in recent years. Felony assault charges were dismissed 
            in July 2008 against one councillor, Marilyn Devaney. In the 2008 election, councillor Kelly A. Timilty falsified the 
            endorsement of the governor and later was fined. The 2008 election generated higher than usual interest in Council seats, 
            but all of the incumbents were reelected.

        <h2 class="underline mt-3">Role in gubernatorial succession</h2>
        <p>
            Originally, the Massachusetts Constitution placed the Governor's Council in the line of executive succession. If the offices of 
            Governor and Lieutenant Governor were both vacant, the Council would act as chief executive. During the colonial period this occurred 
            three times. Following statehood, it occurred only once. After the death of Governor Increase Sumner in 1799, Lieutenant Governor Moses 
            Gill became Acting Governor, and following his death in 1800 the council chaired by Thomas Dawes succeeded to the governorship.
        </p>
        <p>
            The constitutional line of succession was amended in 1918 to remove the Council and insert the "secretary, attorney-general, 
            treasurer and receiver-general, and auditor," in that order.
