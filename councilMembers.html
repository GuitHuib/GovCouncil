            <p>
                Devaney was first elected to Governor’s Council in November 1998, running in a crowded field
                of eight candidates. Now 85 years old, she has proven to be a tenacious candidate – holding on
                for 24 years and 12 elections against numerous primary challengers. She has also held her own
                against general election challengers, although during her tenure Republicans have infrequently
                run a candidate as her district votes strongly Democrat. She has been contested twice in the
                General election by an Independent. In the 2022 primary against Mara Dolan, Devaney won
                her race by 1,658 votes out of 99,080 cast.
            </p>
            <p>
                During her tenure, Devaney has been in the news for her actions both on and off the Council. In
                ____, she was charged with assault for throwing a bag containing a curling iron at a store clerk
                (the charges were dropped after an agreement was reached in which she apologized to the
                clerk). Devaney also received a number of citations for driving with an expired license, expired
                plates, driving an unregistered vehicle and failing to pay fines on the violations.
                https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/watertown-tab/2007/04/27/editorial-is-this-voters-
                last/40643826007/ . She also has received publicity for her rambling and at times off point
                questioning at hearings. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sad-decline-marilyn-m-petitto-
                devaney-district-3-governors-perry/ and her fellow Councilors have expressed their irritation
                with and disdain for her on a regular basis.
                https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/20/metro/primary-importance/
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience interacting with Devaney as a constituent has been mixed. Since 2020, I have
                reached out to her primarily regarding Parole Board appointments and commutations. She is
                extremely responsive, but follows up with a barrage of emails containing long rants complaining
                about the behavior of her fellow Councilors as well as with numerous phone calls. While her
                questions during hearings can be rambling and irrelevant, she has cast a positive vote for all
                three commutations that were nominated by Gov. Baker. She also voted against two candidates
                for the Parole Board, Sherquita Hosang and James Kelcourse, who in my opinion were
                unqualified. While this has not always been the case in the past, in voting against Gloriann
                Moroney for Brockton District Court judge and against the renomination of Collette Santa to
                the Parole Board, Devaney allied herself with those looking to reform the Parole Board. Further,
                she was the only Councilor to champion continuing the livestreaming of the Governor’s Council
                hearings which started during the pandemic
                https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/2022/03/31/motion-to-restore-governors-council-
                livestream-dies-without-a-second/. Devaney prides herself on not being a lawyer. For many
                years, she has been one of only two non-lawyers on the Council (new Councilor, Tara Jacobs
                will make a third). She also prides herself on meeting with all nominees and commutation
                petitioners.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition Devaney has, to her credit, repeatedly and aptly publicly called out the conflicts of
                interest and back door dealing involving her colleagues -- including the large campaign donation
                            
                received by Terrence Kennedy from Gov. Baker’s PAC,

                spending-on-democrats/article_e5f3f3b7-122e-5c8a-8fd8-1723f7da6116.html, the lack of
                transparency and suggestion of political patronage involving the nomination of James Kelcourse
                to the Parole Board, the conflict of interest around the nomination of Councilor Jubinville as
                clerk magistrate https://commonwealthmagazine.org/criminal-justice/governors-councilors-
                seem-supportive-of-jubinville-nomination/, and the nomination of police lieutenant Joseph
                McCarthy to clerk magistrate

                Eileen Duff represents District 5, the northern chunk of Massachusetts which includes the North
                Shore and Merrimack Valley borders New Hampshire. It includes only two cities that are
                diverse: Lawrence and Lowell. Others of the remaining thirty-four towns in her district have less
                diversity, i.e. Amesbury, Pepperell, Wilmington, Rockport, Tewksbury, Danvers, Peabody, and
                Manchester-by-the-Sea. A map of her district is here.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of per capita income, only Andover and Newburyport are ranked in the top 50 in the
                state. Of 300 ranked towns, West Newbury (300), Lawrence (298), Lowell (284) have the lowest
                per capita income.
            </p>
            <p>
                Duff (Dem), who hails from Gloucester, was first elected in November 2012 and assumed office
                on January 3, 2013. She had been challenged in the primary by Donald Bumiller of Boxford and
                David Eppley and George O’Brine, both of Salem, Mass. In 2018, she was challenged by
                Nicholas Torresi of Methuen, but usually she has not faced Democratic challengers. In state
                elections she has however always been challenged by Republicans, occasionally Libertarians,
                and she has won. She has won six times. Her current term ends on January 7, 2027.
            </p>
            <p>
                Duff was born in Peabody, and according to an impartial fact-checking website, has an MA from
                Cambridge College in Management/Organizational Development and a Ph.D. in Ministry from
                Wisdom University in San Francisco. She has done a lot of work on the North Shore, in Beverly
                with Beverly Business Today and Beverly Cable Access Show. She also is or has been a member
                of quite a few organizations including American Association of University Women, the Beverly
                Chamber of Commerce and Salem Chamber of Commerce.
            </p>
            <p>
                She tried to run for state auditor in 2021 but did not make the ballot according to Ballotpedia,
                although she says she withdrew from the race because of family issues. Duff also ran and lost for
                chairmanship of Democratic State Committee in 2016 to Steve Kerrigan. Her only successful
                elected position has been as governor’s councilor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Duff has raised a total of $288,840 in six races for Governor’s Council since 2012. In terms of
                political donations, she gave money to Deval Patrick, Mara Dolan (who ran against fellow
                councilor Marilyn Devaney) and Gov. Maura Healy.

                Graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Boston and Boston College Law School.
                Kennedy, a resident of Everett and a practicing attorney, served as an assistant
                attorney general in Middlesex and Norfolk counties. His current practices specializes
                in criminal and civil law.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kennedy was first elected to Governor’s Council in November 2000, after narrowly
                winning a primary by 80 votes (21,659 to 21,579, with 15,730 blanks), and going on
                to win 55 percent to of the vote in the general election against three candidates. In the
                seven subsequent elections he has been unopposed in the primary three times and had
                one or two primary opponents in other primaries. In 2020, he defeated Helina Fontes
                by 55-45 percent, but in all other contested primaries he has received between 65 and
                95 percent of the votes. After his narrow first election, Kennedy has been unopposed
                three times, but even in those instances in which he has faced a republican opponent,
                he has garnered between 70 and 98 percent of the vote (achieving the latter in three of
                those final elections).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 2020 national election year, the last time Kennedy was opposed, the number of
                ballots in both elections was much higher, but the percentage of blank votes was
                pretty much the same (25 percent in the primary, 27 percent in the final). It appears
                the up-ballot races increased overall turnout, such that the primary total was 44
                percent of the final votes cast (196,425 in the primary; 437,099 in the final).
                In his most recent election, 25 percent of the ballots were blank. Interestingly, that is
                the same percentage of blank votes cast in the primary, although the primary had a
                little over a third as many total ballots (99,123 in the primary; 278,371 in the final).

                Tara Jacobs is the newest member of the Governor’s Council having been elected in Nov. 2022 to fill the
                8th district seat vacated by Mary Hurley’s retirement. Ms. Jacobs, a marketing consultant, served as an
                elected member of the North Adams School Committee and the chair of the Trustees of the North
                Adams Public Library. She also served on the Berkshire County Commission on the Status of women, the
                Northern Berkshire Local Cultural Council, and the chair of the North Adams Democratic City
                Committee.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Democratic primary, Ms. Jacobs ran against 3 candidates, all of whom are lawyers. Mary Hurley
                endorsed one of Ms. Jacobs’ challengers. Further, she ran with a significant fundraising deficit as
                compared to the other 3 candidates. According to her campaign manager, Jacobs ran a grassroots, boots
                on the ground, campaign. They traveled to all areas of the large 8th district which spans all Western
                Massachusetts including communities in Berkshire, Hampshire, Hampden, Franklin and Worcester
                Counties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ms. Jacobs trounced her Republican challenger, John Comerford 61.8% to 38.1%, (170,120 votes to
                104,839). Jacobs and Comerford could not have been further apart on the issues, with Comerford
                stating in the debate with Jacobs that judges are “100%” too lenient, he doesn’t believe in granting
                parole and “if people who are poor can’t do the time, then I suggest they don’t do the crime.” In
                contrast Ms. Jacobs spoke about the importance of pardons and commutations as a “symbol of hope
                and a reason to work towards rehabilitation.” She also expressed her belief that members of the Council
                should be active in recruiting qualified and diverse candidates to be judges and members of the Parole
                Board and make it a “priority to persuade the governor to select them.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ms. Jacobs’ website emphasizes her commitment to “Equity, Inclusion, Accountability and Social Justice
                for All. She pledges to work on dismantling systemic injustice and promoting accountability and
                transparency on the part of the Governor’s Council.
