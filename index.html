        <div class="col-md-8 col-12">
            The Governor’s Council is made up of eight elected Councilors, each from a district made up of five
            senate districts, and the Lieutenant Governor. Its most well known function is to approve or disapprove
            judges nominated by the Governor. But it also votes on members of the Parole Board, pardons and
            commutations, and on the removal of justices of the peace and notaries.

        <h2 class="underline col-md-4 col-12">Where did the Governor's Council originate?</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-12">
            The Governor’s Council is a survival of the council that governed Massachusetts when it was a colony of
            Great Britain which was incorporated into the Massachusetts constitution when the Commonwealth
            became a state. Since then, its role has been reduced by constitutional amendment, but never
            eliminated completely. Originally, the Councilors were elected by the legislature, but are now elected by
            popular vote.

        <div class="col-md-8 col-12">
            Originally, the Councilors were elected by the legislature, but are now elected by
            popular vote. Typically, once elected, incumbents can stay in office as long as they choose. Currently, the longest
            serving Councilor is Christopher Iannella, Jr., of the 4 th District, first elected in 1984. In that first race, he
            won with 30% of the vote in a Democratic primary with seven candidates. Similarly, Marilyn Petitto
            Devaney of the 3rd District won her first Democratic primary in 1998 with 18% of the vote against six
            other candidates.

            <p>
                Your Governor’s Councilor is <span class="bold">your</span> elected official who is asked to vote to:
            </p>
            <ul class="decorated">
                <li>Confirm all the judges in Massachusetts</li>
                <li>Confirm all the Massachusetts parole board members</li>
                <li>Confirm every commutation and pardon in Massachusetts</li>
                <li>And to do much more</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Decisions by judges and Parole Board members have an outsized effect on over-policed
                communities, brown and Black people in particular, and the incarcerated population.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Governor’s Councilor-- that <span class="bold">you</span> elect every two years-- is your voice for who becomes a
                judge or Parole Board member in MA. There are eight districts (and eight councilors) across
                Massachusetts, each comprising many different communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Former Governor Baker nominated over 270 judges to lifetime appointments during his
                tenure—not <span class="bold">one</span> of these nominations was rejected by the Council. Baker’s appointments to
                the bench were, at least, 60% prosecutors. If we want judges who are qualified, diverse, with a
                variety of backgrounds, the Governor’s Council is our voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                And what about Baker’s nominations to the Parole Board? The entire current Board was
                nominated by Baker and confirmed by the Council despite internal Council disagreement and
                significant opposition by advocates to several candidates. The Parole Board would benefit by
                having someone formerly incarcerated as well as more experts in substance use and those with
                social work, education, and sociology backgrounds, i.e., not so many members from law
                enforcement.
            </p>

                Despite the importance of the Governor’s Council in the lives of Black and brown communities, the 8-
                member Governor’s Council has no members of color.
