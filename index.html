        <div class="col-md-8 col-12">
            The Massachusetts Governor's Council, also known as the Executive Council, is composed of <a href="/councilMembers">eight individuals</a>  elected from districts, 
            and the Lieutenant Governor who serves ex officio. The eight councillors are elected from their respective districts every two years. 
            The Council meets weekly to record advice and consent on warrants for the state treasury, pardons and commutations, and recording advice 
            and consent to gubernatorial appointments such as judges, clerk-magistrates, public administrators, members of the Parole Board, 
            Appellate Tax Board, Industrial Accident Board and Industrial Accident Reviewing Board, notaries, and justices of the peace.

            While councillors are elected by the general public and their duties are set forth in the Massachusetts Constitution, they virtually always
            run unapposed, and the actions of the council are largely unreported. The result is a government body that faces no real oversight, and 
            councillors that face no repurcussion for inapropriate behavior. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptas, magnam
