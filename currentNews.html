            Executive clemency for offenses violating state law refers to both pardons and commutations and is a
            power held in Massachusetts by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Massachusetts
            Governor's Council.

            To properly understand the role of the Parole Board, one needs to understand the difference between
            pardons and commutations and how parole works. A pardon is forgiveness of the offense. A
            commutation is not forgiveness of a crime but a reduction in sentence. An incarcerated person becomes
            eligible for parole, i.e. supervised release into the community, after they have served the minimum
            number of years of a sentence that is a range for example, 15 years to life. The person appears before
            the Parole Board which determines whether an individual continues to be a risk to public safety or not.

        <h2>Pardons</h2>
        <p>
            Clemency in the form of a pardon functions as forgiveness of an offense to “remove the barriers that are
            sometimes associated with a criminal record, thereby facilitating the reintegration of the petitioner into
            his or her community.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Petitions for pardons are filed with the Advisory Board of Pardons (aka the Parole Board). The Board
            reviews and decides whether to grant a hearing. After the hearing, the Board votes on whether to
            recommend that the governor pardon the individual. If the Governor recommends a pardon, the
            Governor’s Council must confirm with a majority of positive votes. The lieutenant governor casts the
            deciding vote if there is a tie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Governor Baker issued 17 pardons in the fall of 2022, mostly for decades-old offenses. All were
            unanimously confirmed by the Governor’s Council except for two, which Governor Baker
            withdrew when it appeared he did not have the votes on the Council after a tumultuous
            hearing with strong opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, Governor Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who came into office the same
            time as Baker, pardoned 1,906 formerly incarcerated people and commuted 45 life sentences,
            as of April 2022.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="m-3">
        <h2>Commutations</h2>
        <p>
            Typically, commutation petitions are filed by people serving 1 st degree murder and thus life without
            parole sentences. A commutation reduces such a sentence to life with the possibility of parole after at
            least 15 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Petitions for commutations are filed with the Advisory Board of Pardons (aka the Parole Board). And
            similar to the pardon process, the Board reviews and decides whether to grant a hearing. After the
            hearing, the Board votes on whether to recommend commutation to the governor.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the governor grants the commutation request, it is sent to the Governor’s Council to confirm. The
            Council holds its own public hearing. A majority of votes is needed to ratify the governor’s decision. If
            there is a tie vote, the lieutenant governor casts the deciding vote.
        </p>
        <p>
            If confirmed, the petitioner is now eligible for parole and returns to the Parole Board for a hearing.
        </p>
        <p>
            [In response to your confusion, yes two hearings on the same case: one for commutation, and the other
            for parole. Stupid I know, because if they recommended commutation, they clearly think the individual
            is ready to be released into the community. The second hearing will likely focus more on the parole plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there have been varying reports over the years regarding the number of commutation or pardon
            petitions that have been made to the Parole Board, it is clear that these petitions are rarely granted.
        </p>
        <p>
            During Deval Patrick’s eight-year tenure, he approved one commutation (the first in 17 years) and four
            pardons. This occurred in 2014, his last year in office, and they were confirmed by the Governor’s
            Council.
        </p>
        <p>
            During Baker’s eight-year term, he approved three commutations in 2022, again in his last year in office.
            In these three cases the Council voted unanimously to confirm the Governor’s recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Parole Board in 2023 began posting a calendar for clemency hearings. There have been several
            scheduled hearings but as of yet no recommendations to Governor Healey. [maybe we should not
            include this since it will have to be updated]

        <h2>The Parole Board</h2>
        <p>
            The Governor’s Council provides advice and consent to gubernatorial appointments to the Parole Board,
            voting on appointments after a public hearing .
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to pardons and commutations, and parole hearings for people serving life sentences with the
            possibility of parole, board members conduct parole hearings for all people serving less than life
            sentences. Board members are also responsible for termination of parole petitions from those serving
            parole. The agency is also charged with: &quot;providing notice and assistance to victims, supervising people
            on parole in the community, and providing reentry services to those leaving custody with no mandated
            post-release supervision.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Hearings for people serving life sentences with the possibility of parole are held on Tuesdays and
            Thursdays in Natick at the Parole Agency headquarters. They are public but there is no live streaming.
            All other parole hearings ,i.e., people serving less than life sentences, are held the other days of the
            week on site at the prisons, by one or two parole board members. These hearings are not public and no
            counsel is permitted. Decisions are made on the spot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Governor Baker made nine nominations to the Board during his tenure. Three received a unanimous
            vote. The other six hearings featured significant opposition based primarily on what was perceived of as
            a lack of expertise in mental health and substance abuse or a preponderance of prosecutorial
            background.
