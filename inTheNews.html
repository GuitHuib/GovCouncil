            The Governor’s Council has through the years been called such derogatory terms as “clown council”
            but we have found that the problems presented by these elected officials paid more than $35,000 a
            year (for maybe 8 hours a week?) are egregious. They range from <a href="#itn1">bad behavior</a> towards each other
            and the public; <a href="#itn3">back-door deals,</a> a serious <a href="#itn4">lack of transparency</a> including no posting of rules or
            procedures for the public; <a href="#itn2">no primary challengers;</a> and <a href="#itn5">almost always no diversity of councilors,</a> a
            manifestation of structural racism of the council.

            “This past April, Devaney and Councilor Terry Kennedy got into a heated dispute over who
            assaulted whom with a dime. According to the State House News Service account of the incident
            — a deadpan tour de force — Devaney said Kennedy threw the dime at her. Kennedy said he
            merely gave Devaney the dime as a joke — because she had called a reporter to “drop a dime”
            about the fact that the council had stopped livestreaming its proceedings — and that Devaney
            then threw the dime at him. “It wasn’t a curling iron this time,” Kennedy joked, referring to a
            2007 assault and battery charge against Devaney for allegedly throwing a bag containing a hair
            tool at a store clerk.”

            “Former Boston mayor and governor James Michael Curley famously called it a “hock shop,’’
            because members demanded favors or cash in return for their votes. Governor Michael Dukakis
            fought with the council when its members refused for months to schedule hearings for his
            judicial nominees. At the time, one councilor, Joseph A. Langone III, had served six months in
            federal prison for assaulting a federal officer. He promised to “bury’’ a judicial nominee who he
            believed had written the sentencing memo that led to his incarceration, and he claimed during
            her failed confirmation hearing that she “hates Italians.’”
