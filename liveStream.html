        <h2>Records of Council meetings</h2>
        <p>
            Public Records in Massachusetts are available according to 
            <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/public-records-law/public-records-request.htm"
            target="_blank">
            Chapter 66, Section 10 of the
            Massachusetts General Laws.</a> Records of agencies and municipalities are presumed to be
            public. However when Laura Berland (see youtube video ) asked the Governor’s Council
            executive secretary for voting information by the Council, she was told that it was so time
            intensive that she would have to go into the office and get it herself.

            This 30 second video, made by Jean Trounstine on January 30th at the State House shows Laura
            with a fraction of the stacks of paper documents she would have to go through to find out the
            voting records of each counselor on nominees. In this case, Laura spent more than two hours
            going through paper document records. No votes are digitized or recorded any other way
            except by hand.
